    <h5>The Rules</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Show up on time, leave on time.
        <p>
          Keep an eye on the clock. Please wrap up in a timely manner so that the folks after you can use the space. You can book up to three hours at a time. If you need more than that, please book a consecutive time slot. If your time is running out and there is no one booked for the next spot, feel free to stick around! Please reserve enough time to set up and clean up up after yourself.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Be mindful of whatâ€™s going on around you.
        <p>
          GA offers classes during the day and in the evenings. Please be aware of your volume level to prevent disturbing classes and meetings that are in session.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Clean up after yourself.
        <p>
          GA Staff is available to help you set up and break down your meeting space. Please help us keep things running smoothly by cleaning up after yourself so that we can prepare the room for the next activity.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
